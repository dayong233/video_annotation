    "caption": "The recorder extends the left hand with fingers spread and moves the palm toward a beige mug on the tabletop. The left index finger slips through the handle loop, the thumb presses on top of the handle, and the other fingers support the mug body to lift it. The recorder moves to the sink on the left, holds the mug upright under the faucet spout, and raises the faucet lever upward with the right hand. After the water starts, the left hand maintains the grasp while the right hand releases the lever and steadies the mug; both hands make small shakes and counterclockwise rotations under the stream to rinse the inside wall. The recorder pinches the faucet handle with the right hand and presses it down to shut off the water, while rotating the left wrist inward clockwise to invert the mug and pour the water into the drain. The right hand lets go of the lever and pulls back, and the left wrist rotates back to bring the mug opening upward before setting the mug on the table. The recorder turns left and walks to the refrigerator, grasps and pulls open the right door with the right hand, then grasps and pulls open the left door with the left hand. The right hand reaches to the top shelf on the left inside and grips the handle of a milk jug (thumb outside, fingers curled inside), then lifts it out. The left hand pushes the left refrigerator door closed, shifts to the edge of the right door, and pushes it inward—grabbing the handle midway to finish closing. Turning right, the recorder walks back to the mug, uses the left thumb and index finger to twist the jug cap counterclockwise, holds the cap, and reaches toward the mug. The recorder lifts the mug by the handle, tilts the milk jug by rotating the wrist downward and raising the arm, and pours a small amount of milk into the mug; the mug is set back down and the jug is brought upright. The left hand places the blue cap back onto the jug opening; the right hand sets the jug on the table while the left hand supports the jug side, and the right thumb and index finger tighten the cap clockwise. The recorder lifts the mug again and moves to the microwave, hooks the right fingers through the microwave door handle to pull it open, then releases the handle and places the mug with a small amount of milk inside. The left hand pushes the door closed, the right thumb reaches the control panel, the left hand releases the handle, and the right thumb presses a button to set the time or start heating.",
